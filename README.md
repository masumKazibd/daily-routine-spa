## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
* A web browser
* A free [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repo (or save the `index.html` file):**
    If this were a Git repository, you would clone it. For this project, simply save the provided `index.html` file to a folder on your computer.

2.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    * Inside your new project, go to the **Authentication** section, click the "Sign-in method" tab, and **enable** the **Email/Password** provider.
    * Go to the **Firestore Database** section, click "Create database," start in **production mode**, and choose a location. Then, go to the **Rules** tab and replace the default rules with the following to allow users to access their own data:
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    * Publish the new rules.

3.  **Get Your Firebase Config Keys:**
    * In your Firebase project settings (click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon), scroll down to "Your apps."
    * Click the web icon (`</>`) to create a new web app.
    * Give it a nickname and click "Register app."
    * Copy the `firebaseConfig` object.

4.  **Add Your Keys to the Code:**
    * Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.
    * Find the `firebaseConfig` object within the `<script type="module">` tag.
    * Replace the placeholder values with the keys you just copied from your Firebase project.

5.  **Run the App:**
    You can now open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser to use the application locally.

## üåê Deployment

This application is ready to be deployed to any static site hosting service.

1.  **Choose a Host:** Free options like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are excellent choices.
2.  **Deploy:** Most services offer a simple drag-and-drop interface where you can upload your `index.html` file.
3.  **Authorize Your Domain:** **This is a critical final step!**
    * Go back to your Firebase project's **Authentication** settings.
    * Click the **Settings** tab.
    * Under **Authorized domains**, click "Add domain" and enter the live URL provided by your hosting service (e.g., `your-awesome-app.netlify.app`).
